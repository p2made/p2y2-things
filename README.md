# ¡¡ Notice !!

After an extented period of life getting in the way I'm back to [Yii2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) development. I'll be rebasing every project as I resume work on it. Projects that use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) will resume as version `5.0.0` for Bootstrap 5.x.

2025-03-31 - As part of the rebase I am making a release `5.x-reboot` as soon as I commit this update to the README. I will then set almost all classes aside pending review. If `master`, `dev`, or the most recent release is missing something that you require, use `5.x-reboot` until that part is reinstated.

A collection of resources as Assets, Helpers, & Widgets for Yii2.

Version 5 is so numbered because I've migrated P2Y2Things to using Bootstrap v5.

# Wow 😱 so much empty

That will change as classes are rebased & reinstated.

Stay tuned.
